# MYRED Roadmap — Progress

MYRED is a Redis-compatible in-memory database written from scratch in C++. It
speaks RESP and works with `redis-cli`, Redis clients, and `redis-benchmark`
where the implemented command surface allows.

**This file is one of three** (split 2026-07-21 to keep each readable):
- `ROADMAP.md` (this file) — current focus + completed milestones + testing matrix.
- `BACKLOG.md` — everything not started: future milestones, deferred items, feature gaps, open bugs.
- `DECISIONS.md` — design decisions, architecture notes, and conventions.

Companion: `CODE_REVIEW.md` — audit worklist + Resolved Bugs Archive.

## Current Snapshot

Date: 2026-07-21.

Primary commands:
```bash
cmake -B build
cmake --build build
./build/server myred.conf
python3 scripts/stress_test.py --password <pass>
python3 scripts/stress_test.py --tls --tls-insecure --port 1235 --password <pass>   # over TLS
```

Runtime assumptions:
- Default plaintext port `1234`; TLS via `tls-port` (see `myred.conf`).
- Config loaded with `./build/server myred.conf` or `MYRED_CONFIG`.
- `scripts/stress_test.py` is the primary correctness/stress harness (now `--tls`-aware).

Implemented command families:

| Area | Status |
|---|---|
| RESP2 parser and writers | Implemented |
| Strings / Lists / Hashes / Sets | Implemented |
| Sorted sets | Implemented subset |
| Generic keyspace commands | Implemented subset |
| RDB + AOF persistence (+ rewrite) | Implemented |
| Memory accounting and eviction | Implemented |
| Config file + password hashing (Argon2id) | Implemented |
| ACL foundation and hardening | Implemented (V9.4–V9.5) |
| **TLS** | **Implemented (V9.7)** |
| Pub/Sub | In progress (V8.1 → Current Focus) |
| Transactions | Not implemented (→ BACKLOG V8.4) |
| Replication | Not implemented (→ BACKLOG V10) |

Do not rely on old test-count claims; run the harness for the current count.

## Current Focus

### V8 - Pub/Sub [In Progress]

Redis Pub/Sub: a live broadcast mechanism with **no storage and no persistence** —
a message only reaches clients subscribed *at the moment* it is published, then
it is gone. Built in three ordered steps; each is independently testable before
the next starts. (Transactions — `MULTI`/`EXEC`/`WATCH`, the other half of the
old combined "V8" milestone — stay in `BACKLOG.md` as V8.4/V8.5; they share the
number for scheduling only and are an unrelated feature.)

#### V8.1 - Pub/Sub core: `SUBSCRIBE` / `UNSUBSCRIBE` / `PUBLISH` [Next]

Exact-channel-name matching only — no glob patterns yet (that's V8.2).

- New registry on `GlobalData`:
  `std::unordered_map<std::string, std::unordered_set<Conn*>> channels`
  (channel name → subscribed conns). Direct lookup, no scanning.
- `SUBSCRIBE channel [channel...]`: add the conn to each channel's set; reply with
  Redis's per-channel `subscribe` confirmation array (name, running subscription count).
- `PUBLISH channel msg`: look up `channels[channel]`, and for each subscribed
  `Conn*`, RESP-encode a `message` push reply straight into that conn's
  `outgoing` (same `buf_append` every command already uses) and set
  `want_write = true`. Reply with the receiver count.
- **This needs zero event-loop changes.** The poll loop (`server.cpp`) rebuilds
  `poll_args` from every `Conn`'s `want_read`/`want_write` flags fresh each tick,
  so `PUBLISH` mutating a *different* connection's buffer and flipping its
  `want_write` flag is picked up automatically on the next `poll()` call — no
  eventfd, no cross-thread signaling. Still one synchronous call within the same
  event-loop iteration as any other command; `PUBLISH` just happens to touch
  more than one `Conn`.
- Subscribe-mode command gating: once a `Conn` has ≥1 subscription, `do_request`
  needs to reject everything except `SUBSCRIBE`/`UNSUBSCRIBE`/`PING`/`RESET`/
  `QUIT` (Redis's RESP2 rule) — a `size_t sub_count` on `Conn`, checked the same
  way `do_request` already gates on `conn->user` being null, just a different
  per-conn mode.
- `UNSUBSCRIBE` with no arguments means "unsubscribe from everything."
- Teardown: `conn_destroy` must remove the conn from every channel set it's in —
  a new cleanup step alongside the idle-list/io-list detach it already does.
- Done when: a Python test harness client can `SUBSCRIBE`, a second connection
  `PUBLISH`es, and the first receives the message — plus subscribe-mode gating
  rejects a plain `GET` while subscribed.

#### V8.2 - Pattern subscriptions + channel ACL [Backlog]

Do not start until V8.1 is solid — this only adds a second matching path on top of it.

- `PSUBSCRIBE`/`PUNSUBSCRIBE`: separate registry, a list of `{pattern, subscribers}`.
  `PUBLISH` gains a second step — glob-match the channel against every
  registered pattern (linear scan; exact-match in V8.1 stays a direct lookup) —
  and sends a `pmessage` (not `message`) push reply to pattern matches.
- **Correcting a stale note that used to be here:** there is no existing
  ACL channel-pattern field to reuse — `User` (`state.h:100-108`) only has
  `key_patterns` for key-scoped ACL. Real channel-scoped ACL (Redis's `&pattern`
  rule) needs a new `channel_patterns` field added to `User`, mirroring
  `key_patterns`' shape. Until that lands, ship Pub/Sub with all channels open to
  any user holding Pub/Sub category access — same coarse granularity most
  commands already have.
- Done when: `PSUBSCRIBE news.*` receives a `PUBLISH news.sports ...` as a
  `pmessage`, and a plain `SUBSCRIBE news.sports` from V8.1 still also gets it as
  a separate `message` — both paths fire independently off one `PUBLISH`.

#### V8.3 - Keyspace notifications [Backlog]

Rides entirely on top of V8.1/V8.2 — this step is wiring, not new mechanism.

- One `notify_keyspace_event(class, event, key)` helper that internally calls the
  now-existing `PUBLISH` path. Hook points are few and already identified:
  lazy expiry (`expire_if_needed`), active expiry (`process_timers`' TTL drain),
  eviction (`free_memory_if_needed`), and the write handlers themselves.
  Covers Redis-compatible `K`/`E` channel semantics (`notify-keyspace-events`
  config) without touching the dispatch path.
- Done when: `CONFIG SET notify-keyspace-events KEA`, a `PSUBSCRIBE
  __keyevent@0__:*`, and a plain `SET`/`EXPIRE`/eviction each produce the
  expected event on that channel.

**TLS carry-over (still open):** a full TLS suite re-run after the V9.7.5 flags
(session resumption + `SSL_MODE_RELEASE_BUFFERS`) landed — the 555/551 gate runs
predate those two config lines. Once green, V9.7 is fully closed. A commit
checkpoint of the V9.7.2→.5 body plus the docs reorg is also outstanding.

## Completed Milestones

### V9 - Security and Auth [Done]

Config file → hashed credentials → protected mode → ACLs → command hardening →
Argon2id → TLS.

- **V9.1 Config File Foundation** — shared `config_apply()`; `config_tokenize()`
  (comments + quotes); precedence defaults < file < env < `CONFIG SET`;
  `CONFIG REWRITE`.
- **V9.2 Password Hashing + Constant-Time Compare** — `requirepass` as SHA-256 /
  `#<hex>`; `AUTH` compares with `ct_equal`; plaintext wiped with `secure_zero`.
- **V9.3 Protected Mode / Bind / Allowlist** — multi-address `bind`; protected
  mode rejects non-loopback with no password; `allow-ip` CIDR in `handle_accept`
  (loopback always exempt).
- **V9.4 ACL Foundation** — `User` registry under `Config::users`; `Conn::user`
  identity; `CmdSpec` categories + key specs; `AUTH <user> <pass>`; `ACL
  SETUSER/GETUSER/DELUSER/LIST/USERS/WHOAMI/CAT/GENPASS`; users round-trip rewrite.
- **V9.5 Command Hardening + Audit Log** (2026-07-11) — category semantics
  (control-plane commands drop `@read`/`@write`, `acl_check` stays O(1), NOPERM
  before arity); real `KEYS` glob; precise key resolvers (`SMOVE`,
  `OBJECT`/`MEMORY`); `rename-command`/disable with canonical `g_dispatch`; audit
  log (`auth_*`, `acl_deny`, `acl_change`, `admin/dangerous_command`,
  `accept_reject`; never secrets); `metadata_selfcheck()` boot guard.
- **V9.6 Password Hashing Upgrade → Argon2id** (closed 2026-07-18) — self-
  describing credentials (`cred.h/cpp`; legacy SHA-256 forever-verifiable vs
  `$argon2id$` PHC); async verify on the thread pool via eventfd completion
  channel (`k_max_auth_inflight=4`, ~76 MiB cap; `Conn::id` liveness;
  `auth_pending` gating + `conn_resume`; uniform-timing dummy for unknown users);
  rehash-on-AUTH migration with value-matched CAS + `cred_rehash` audit.
  - **V9.6.4 audit bug sweep** (2026-07-17) — closed every open 🔴/🟠/🟡 + 🔵/⚪
    from the CODE_REVIEW consolidated audit (move semantics, 64-bit FNV-1a,
    `mem_selfcheck` placement, `hm_random` O(k) SPOP/SRANDMEMBER, incremental
    eviction `evict_tick`, O(1) INFO stats). Bonus: SPOP AOF determinism, RDB
    non-TTL-set loader data loss, ECHO + empty-inline (`--pipe` compat).
  - **V9.6.5 general + speed test** (2026-07-18) — new suites
    `test_restart_matrix.py` + `test_security.py` (+ `myred_testlib.py`), both
    `--destructive` green (caught 4 real bugs, all fixed); delta accounting
    (`Deque::elem_bytes` + `HMap::elem_bytes`, O(1) `entry_mem_usage`, drift-
    verified 0). Baselines recorded (see Testing Matrix).

### V9.7 - TLS [Done]

Real `redis-cli --tls` / `redis-benchmark --tls` round-trips; plaintext and TLS
listeners serve simultaneously. Built in five ordered steps so the event-loop
breakage was absorbed before any crypto existed. OpenSSL lives entirely behind a
transport seam — `server.cpp` includes no OpenSSL headers.

- **V9.7.1 Transport seam** — `transport.h/.cpp`: `IoResult` +
  `tr_read/tr_write/tr_close`. All per-conn socket I/O routes through it.
  `Conn::tr_want_read/tr_want_write` (transport demand) OR'd into poll flags
  beside application intent; poll asserts relaxed to guards. Zero behavior change.
- **V9.7.2 Context / config / listeners** — five boot-only `tls-*` directives
  through `config_apply`/`config_rewrite` (+ `do_config` reject); one global
  `SSL_CTX` (`TLS1.2` min, `SSL_OP_NO_RENEGOTIATION`, default ECDHE,
  `PARTIAL_WRITE | ACCEPT_MOVING_WRITE_BUFFER` — the moving-buffer flag is
  mandatory because `Buffer` slides between write retries); `Listener {fd,
  is_tls}`; `tr_tls_attach` on accept, no synchronous `SSL_accept`.
- **V9.7.3 Handshake as connection state** — `Conn::tls_handshaking` + a
  dedicated `hs_list` with a tighter `tls-handshake-timeout` (10 s default);
  `tr_handshake` maps `WANT_READ/WRITE` to the transport-demand flags; failed
  handshakes `audit_event("tls_handshake_fail")` + destroy.
- **V9.7.4 Data path** — `tr_read/tr_write` branch on `c->ssl`; classify with
  `SSL_get_error`, never errno (`ZERO_RETURN`→PEER_CLOSED, syscall/SSL→ERR);
  `handle_read` loops on `tr_has_pending` (uses `SSL_has_pending`, stronger than
  the roadmap's `SSL_pending` — catches unprocessed pipelined records); poll
  dispatch became **intent-driven** (drive by want_read/want_write, either-
  direction readiness retries) so a TLS read can block on POLLOUT and a write on
  POLLIN; `tr_close` one-shot best-effort `SSL_shutdown`.
- **V9.7.5 Optimizations (body)** — session resumption (`SSL_SESS_CACHE_SERVER`,
  verified `Reused,TLSv1.3` via `s_client -sess_out/-sess_in`), record-sized-flush
  invariant verified (no code), `SSL_MODE_RELEASE_BUFFERS`. Remaining opts
  (accept-storm cap, kTLS, cert reload) parked in `BACKLOG.md`.

Gate (2026-07-21, native Linux): authed **555/555** on :1235, passwordless
**551/551** on :1337, full `--bench` + stress suite green over TLS. TLS
throughput retains a healthy fraction of plaintext; the LRANGE curve (bigger
replies → bigger TLS hit) is the expected shape.

### Earlier milestones [Done]

- **V5.2 String Command Expansion** — variadic `DEL`/`EXISTS`;
  `INCR*`/`DECR*`/`INCRBYFLOAT`; `SETNX/SETEX/PSETEX/GETSET/GETEX/GETDEL`;
  `MSET/MGET/MSETNX`; `APPEND/STRLEN/GETRANGE/SETRANGE` (overflow guards, NaN/inf
  rejection, Redis negative-index semantics, 512 MB cap).
- **V5.3 Project-Wide Code Review** — `Entry::val` → `std::variant`; dispatch →
  `CmdSpec`; `std::mt19937_64`; centralized lazy expiry; iterative `glob_match`;
  portable `container_of`; server/RDB hardening; stronger build warnings.
- **V6 Persistence Hardening** — AOF buffering, mutation-gated logging, TTL →
  absolute `PEXPIREAT`, `appendfsync` policies, replay through the command path,
  `BGREWRITEAOF`, RDB/AOF startup priority, crash recovery/truncation,
  `--check-aof`/`--fix`, disk-full policy, config save triggers.
- **V6 Optimization Pass** — templated `aof_encode`; raw RESP AOF path; hybrid
  RDB-preamble + RESP-delta; `INFO persistence`. (Skipped `writev()` — unproven.)
- **V6.1 Redis Tooling Compatibility** — `PING`, inline protocol, `ZPOPMIN`,
  variadic `ZADD`. (Gap: `COMMAND`/`COMMAND DOCS`/`COMMAND COUNT` → BACKLOG.)
- **V7 Memory Management** — `Entry::mem` accounting, `used_memory`/`INFO
  memory`, `maxmemory`, Redis eviction policy names, LRU/LFU metadata, sampling
  victim selection, write-path eviction + OOM, AOF eviction propagation,
  `MEMORY USAGE/STATS/DOCTOR`, `OBJECT ENCODING/IDLETIME/FREQ/REFCOUNT`.
  (Deferred: compact encodings, shared-object refcounting, 16-slot eviction pool
  → BACKLOG.)

## Testing Matrix

Primary harness (`--tls`-aware since 2026-07-21):
```bash
python3 scripts/stress_test.py
python3 scripts/stress_test.py --correctness-only
python3 scripts/stress_test.py --stress-only --stress-threads 16 --stress-ops 2000
python3 scripts/stress_test.py --bench                                   # + redis-benchmark
python3 scripts/stress_test.py --tls --tls-insecure --port 1235 --password <pass>
python3 scripts/stress_test.py --tls --tls-insecure --port 1337 --bench  # passwordless TLS bench
```

Restart / security / eviction suites:
```bash
python3 scripts/test_restart_matrix.py [--destructive]   # private instance, port 12401
python3 scripts/test_security.py       [--destructive]   # private instance, port 12402
scripts/test_evict_tick.sh                                # EVICT_RUNNING regression
scripts/test_aof.sh  scripts/test_aof_rewrite.sh  scripts/test_aof_hybrid.sh
```

**Benchmark only on a Release build** (`cmake -B build-rel -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release`;
Debug runs `mem_selfcheck`'s whole-keyspace walk per command and poisons numbers).
Same-machine comparisons only. Benchmark TLS against a **passwordless** instance —
`redis-benchmark`'s 50-client AUTH storm hits `k_max_auth_inflight=4`.

Recorded baselines (`-n 100000 -c 50 -P 16`, ops/sec):
- **WSL2 Release** (2026-07-18, plaintext): PING 1.01M · SET 1.06M · GET 1.02M ·
  INCR 1.00M · LPUSH 870k · SADD 917k · HSET 926k · SPOP 1.02M · ZADD 917k ·
  ZPOPMIN 1.06M · MSET(10) 327k · LRANGE 100/300/500/600 103k/41.5k/25.5k/16.9k.
- **Native Linux** (2026-07-18, plaintext, ~2.2–2.5× WSL): PING 2.78M · SET
  2.22M · GET 2.50M · SPOP 2.63M · ZADD 1.92M · MSET 833k. Cool-machine reference;
  a warm back-to-back run throttles ~½ (watch for a GET<SET anomaly = throttled).
- **Native Linux TLS** (2026-07-21, passwordless :1337): PING_MBULK 1.02M · SET
  901k · GET 971k · SADD 826k · SPOP 926k · HSET 833k · MSET(10) 412k · LRANGE
  100/300/500/600 133k/34k/11.4k/9.0k. TLS overhead scales with bytes/op — small
  ops stay high, bulk-range takes the biggest hit. (Same-session plaintext ran
  warm/throttled — re-run isolated for a clean ratio.)

Full logs: `docs/stress_results.md`, `docs/bench_plain.md`, `docs/bench_tls.md`,
`docs/stress_tls.md` (test-result files stay in `docs/`, separate from these
planning docs).

Security test focus: `AUTH` success/failure/lockout, `AUTH <user> <pass>`, `ACL
SETUSER` + config round-trip, command/key-pattern denial, protected-mode +
allowlist rejection, audit redaction, renamed-command canonical AOF.
